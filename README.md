# Species-aware multi-task learning with molecular and ADME descriptors for liver microsomal metabolic stability
Authors: Subhin Seomun, Sunyong Yoo

## Description
This project introduces a species-aware, multi-task, multi-modal framework for predicting liver microsomal metabolic stability across human (HLM), rat (RLM), and mouse (MLM). Our model fuses SMILES-derived fingerprints, graph-neural features, and in-silico ADME/physicochemical descriptors to improve cross-species generalization and to explain model decisions. Interpretability combines descriptor-level SHAP  with EdgeSHAPer, plus fragmentâ€“ADME enrichment to link local chemistries to system-level properties. The repository contains:
- **[Dataset](https://github.com/bmil-jnu/MTMM-CYP/tree/main/Dataset)**: The dataset used in the paper.
- **[Figures](https://github.com/bmil-jnu/MTMM-CYP/tree/main/Figures)**: High-resolution figures used throughout the paper.
